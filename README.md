# Ideal-weight 
Write a program to compute the ideal weight for both males and females. According to one study, the ideal weight for a female is 100 pounds plus 5 pounds for each inch in height over 5 feet. For example, the ideal weight for a female who is 5'3" would be 100 + 15 = 115 pounds. For a male the ideal weight is 106 pounds plus 6 pounds for each inch in height over 5 feet. For example, the ideal weight for a male who is 6'2" would be 106 + 14*6 = 190 pounds. Your program should ask the user to enter his/her height in feet and inches (both as integers—so a person 5'3" would enter the 5 and the 3). It should then compute and print both the ideal weight for a female and the ideal weight for a male. The general outline of your main function would be as follows: 

· Declare your variables (think about what variables you need—you need to input two pieces of information (what?), then you need some variables for your calculations (see the following steps) 

· Get the input (height in feet and inches) from the user 

· Compute the total number of inches of height (convert feet and inches to total inches)
 
· Compute the ideal weight for a female and the ideal weight for a male (here you basically convert the "word" description above to assignment statements) 

· Print the answers 

Plan your program, then type it in, compile and run it. Be sure it gives correct answers. 

The weight program would be a bit nicer if it didn't just give one number as the ideal weight for each sex. Generally a person's weight is okay if it is within about 15% of the ideal. Add to your program so that in addition to its current output it prints an okay range for each sex—the range is from the ideal weight minus 15% to the ideal weight plus 15%. You may do this by introducing new variables and assignment statements OR directly within your print statements.
